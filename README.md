# Learning-Style-Classifier
## Final Project for samsung innovation campus(SIC) Scholarship
### Project Description
The process of identifying the learning styles of students is not accurate enough to make a decision or to take an action based on the process results. In this project, we decided to use the power of Artificial Intelligence algorithms to classify learners into groups based on their learning style.
There are 2 problems weâ€™re going to solve in this project
-	The lack of quality of evaluating students to identify their learning style, which leads to wrong results (low accuracy)
-	The evaluation process is slow and time-consuming, regardless of the evaluation method (human-based evaluation, quiz, etc...).
To begin executing on the project, we will break it down into small chunks (challenges), and explain each one in details.

Steps
 -	Generating data (dataset)
 -	Data preprocessing
 -	Building the model (classification algorithm)
 -	Model evaluation
